                        <h3>BenEater's 6502 Project</h3>
                        <p>Currently a WIP, this project was introduced to me by 
                            Professor Danny Jackowitz. I took it upon myself to invest
                            into this project, which thus far has proved to be a rewarding and 
                            enlightening experience. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the first truly low-cost microprocessor that started the personal-computing revolution. 
                            Versions of 6502 found their way into the Atari 2600, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, 
                            Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, BBC Micro and many other computers and game consoles of the era.</p>
